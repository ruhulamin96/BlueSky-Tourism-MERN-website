              Health and Nutrition Tips That Are Evidence-Based
            </h1>
            <h1>1. Limit sugary drinks</h1>
            <p>
              Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are the
              primary source of added sugar in the American diet (1Trusted
              Source). Unfortunately, findings from several studies point to
              sugar-sweetened beverages increasing risk of heart disease and
              type 2 diabetes, even in people who are not carrying excess body
              fat (2Trusted Source). Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely
              harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to obesity
              in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop
              until adulthood, like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and
              non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
            </p>
            <h1>2. Eat nuts and seeds</h1>
            <p>
              Some people avoid nuts because they are high in fat. However, nuts
              and seeds are incredibly nutritious. They are packed with protein,
              fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals (6Trusted Source,
              7Trusted Source). Nuts may help you lose weight and reduce the
              risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease (8Trusted
              Source). Additionally, one large observational study noted that a
              low intake of nuts and seeds was potentially linked to an
              increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke, or type 2
              diabetes
            </p>
            <h1>4. Don’t fear coffee</h1>
            <p>
              Despite some controversy over it, coffee is loaded with health
              benefits. It’s rich in antioxidants, and some studies have linked
              coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes,
              Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses
              (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted
              Source). The most beneficial intake amount appears to be 3–4 cups
              per day, although pregnant people should limit or avoid it
              completely because it has been linked to low birth weight
              (18Trusted Source). However, it’s best to consume coffee and any
              caffeine-based items in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake may
              lead to health issues like insomnia and heart palpitations. To
              enjoy coffee in a safe and healthy way, keep your intake to less
              than 4 cups per day and avoid high-calorie, high-sugar additives
              like sweetened creamer.
